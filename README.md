## Virtual Library Client
This repository contains the client-side implementation of a virtual library application. The client interacts with a server using HTTP requests to perform various operations such as user registration, login, accessing the library, retrieving books, adding books, deleting books, and logging out.

## Features
- User registration: Allows users to create a new account by providing a username and password.
- User login: Enables users to log in to their existing accounts using their credentials.
- Library access: Provides users with access to the library after successful login.
- Get all books: Retrieves and displays all books available in the library.
- Get a specific book: Retrieves and displays detailed information about a particular book based on its ID.
- Add a book: Allows users to add a new book to the library by providing its details such as title, author, genre, page count, and publisher.
- Delete a book: Enables users to remove a book from the library based on its ID.
- Logout: Allows users to log out from their current session.
